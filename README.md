Overview
Overview of the school district analysis:

The concept of this analysis was to discover the general passing rates of students in the data sets. We likewise need to be able to use various tools in the pandas library to be able to sort data and collect data that I want to see.
Results:
How is the district summary affected?

After examining the district summary, there existed no difference.
How is the school summary affected?

The passing rate for Thomas High School in PyCitySchools changes the general passing percentage by 0.3%.
How does substituting the ninth graders’ math and reading scores influence Thomas High School’s performance comparable to the different schools?

The whole data set does not vary the reading or math scores. The rationale for taking out the 9th graders scores was to notice if the school was not including some 9th graders scores to increase their standard. Nonetheless, examining the outcomes was comparable with or without their data, suggesting no information was being influenced.
How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:

The only distinction was the actuality that the scores for the 9th graders who attended Thomas High School evolve into NaN.
Math and reading scores by grade

for 9th graders, the scores are substituted with NaNs, but for the other data, it is the identical.
Scores by school spending

The numbers are nearly the same since the 9th graders are no longer a characteristic in my data set.
Scores by school size

The General Passing Percentage does not alter.
Scores by school type

The scores by the school type do not alter our data.
Conclusion
The final result can conclude that by substituting the scores of the 9th graders there is nothing questionable that can be seen from the data set. In the end, the values replaced with NaN's did not alter the data to be concerned.
